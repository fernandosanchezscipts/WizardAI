## Why I Built It

WizardAI was built to demonstrate the full potential of GPT-4's multimodal capabilities in a user-friendly way. The goal was to create an assistant that not only feels responsive and smart but also looks polished and professional—like something you'd actually want to use daily.

## How It Works

1. Users type a question, upload an image, or send a PDF
2. Backend processes the input and communicates with GPT-4o
3. GPT-4o generates a response based on the content type
4. The frontend renders everything with styled bubbles, animations, and timestamps

## What Makes It Unique

- Custom-built UI with clean animations and responsiveness
- Uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o for visual reasoning
- Combines great UX with real technical functionality
- Built to be easily extended and future-proofed for enterprise applications
